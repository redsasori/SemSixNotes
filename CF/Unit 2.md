   - Helps in investigating domain-related activities and ownership.

9. **Ping and Port Scan**:
   - Ping tests network connectivity by sending ICMP packets.
   - Port scan identifies open ports on a target system.
   - Used for network troubleshooting, security assessments, and reconnaissance.
   - Helps in detecting network issues and vulnerabilities.

10. **Traceroute**:
   - Traces the path packets take from source to destination.
   - Shows network hops and latency between nodes.
   - Useful for diagnosing network routing problems and optimizing network performance.
   - Provides insights into network topology and connectivity.

11. **IP Geolocation**:
   - Determines the geographical location of an IP address.
   - Used for targeted advertising, content localization, and cybersecurity.
   - Helps in identifying user locations and analyzing network traffic patterns.
   - Various databases and services provide IP geolocation information.

12. **Collection-Phase Location Acquisition**:
   - Involves obtaining digital artifacts related to internet usage.
   - Includes data on web browsing history, email correspondence, and IoT devices.
   - Blurs the lines between computer forensics and internet forensics.
   - Browser history, cache, cookies, and DHCP logs are key artifacts.

13. **tcpdump and pcap**:
   - tcpdump captures network packets for analysis.
   - pcap files store captured network data in a standard format.
   - Enables monitoring network traffic and analyzing packet contents.
   - Promiscuous mode allows capturing packets intended for other recipients.

14. **DHCP Logs and Netflow**:
    - DHCP logs track IP address assignments on a network.
    - Netflow provides insights into network traffic patterns.
    - Useful for monitoring network activities and managing IP address assignments.
    - Captured data may be stored for a limited period due to resource constraints.

15. **Types of Content on Social Media**:
    - Includes text, images, videos, links, and documents shared on social platforms.
    - Diverse content formats cater to different user preferences and engagement levels.
    - Social media content can range from personal updates to professional promotions.

16. **Types of Categories on Social Media**:
    - Categories may include personal profiles, business pages, groups, events, and ads.
    - Each category serves specific purposes for users and businesses on social platforms.
    - Helps in organizing content and interactions based on user preferences and objectives.

17. **Social Connections and Associates in Social Media**:
    - Reflects the network of relationships users have on social platforms.
    - Connections can be friends, followers, colleagues, or group members.
    - Social connections influence content visibility, engagement, and networking opportunities.

18. **Different Types of Personal Information Shared on Social Media**:
    - Personal information shared may include demographics, interests, locations, and activities.
    - Users disclose varying levels of personal details based on privacy settings and preferences.
    - Privacy controls and settings help users manage the visibility of their personal information.

19. **Privacy Controls in Social Media**:
    - Settings that allow users to control who can view their content and personal information.
    - Privacy controls help users manage their online presence and protect their data.
    - Users can adjust settings for profile visibility, post sharing, and data access permissions.

20. **Location Data in Social Media**:
    - Location data indicates where users are posting from or their current whereabouts.
    - Used for geotagging posts, check-ins, event attendance, and location-based services.
